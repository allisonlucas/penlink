## PenLink Code Challenge
This project is the solution to the PenLink code challenge. To solve this challenge, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly get up and running.

### Available Scripts

To run the application, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

#### `npm start`

To run the application tests, in the project's root directory run:

#### `npm test`
